Yup, that's [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) -- the eponymous mathematician of this project. And despite his deteriorating eyesight later in life (which may explain his odd sense of style), he made some of the most important contributions to the field of mathematics. 

Below are Python scripts that I've submitted to [ProjectEuler+](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges), which is  HackerRanks's implementation of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). Stay tuned for more solutions :-)
