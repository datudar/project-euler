Yup, that's Euler. Despite his deteriorating eyesight later in life (which may explain his odd fashion sense), he made some of the most important contributions to the field mathematics. 

The following are Python scripts that I've submitted to [ProjectEuler+](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges), which is  HackerRanks's implementation of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). Stay tuned for more solutions :-)
